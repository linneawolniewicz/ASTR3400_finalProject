# ASTR3400_finalProject

Final project for ASTR3400 class. We are evolving a Type 1a Supernova system (Mira) with MESA to determine if it indeed will be produce a supernova.

Currently, we are guessing that Mira A began with 2 M_sun at ZAMS, and Mira B with 4.1 M_sun at ZAMS. We also are assuming they have solar metallity (0.0196) at ZAMS.
